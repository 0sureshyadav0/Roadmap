## Web Developer

Steps:
- Choose a technology based on your interest
- FrontEnd Development
- BackEnd Development
- Database
- Version Control System
- Build Projects

1. Choose a technology:
```
i. MERN - The most popular and trending technology 
```
- MongoDB - A NoSQL database that deals with data.
- Express - A framework for NodeJS and handles GET, PUT, POST, DELETE functions
- React - A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces, building single-page applications.
- NodeJS - An open-source server environment

ii. MEAN - The major difference between MERN and MEAN is MERN (written in JavaScript) works on React whereas MEAN deals with Angular ( a framework written in TypeScript ).

6. Build Projects:
When you're all done with the theory part, do build some projects to be well-versed with full-stack development. You implement all the front-ent, and back-end sides of a project along with database handling, then you get perfect in web development. As you build something, you get familiar with the technical concepts like how APIs connect the front-end to the back-end, how the datacase manages data, and various other steps followed during web development. Thus ccultivate a habit of building projects to become a successful web developer.
