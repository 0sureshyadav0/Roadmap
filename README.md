# Roadmap
Here, you can find roadmap to learn different technologies.

## Web Developer

Steps:
- Choose a technology based on your interest
- FrontEnd Development
- BackEnd Development
- Database
- Version Control System
- Build Projects

1. Choose a technology:
```
i. MERN - The most popular and trending technology 
```
- MongoDB - A NoSQL database that deals with data.
- Express - A framework for NodeJS and handles GET, PUT, POST, DELETE functions
- React - A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces, building single-page applications.
- NodeJS - An open-source server environment

```
ii. MEAN - The major difference between MERN and MEAN is MERN (written in JavaScript) works on React whereas MEAN deals with Angular ( a framework written in TypeScript ).
```
2. FrontEnd Development
Front-End is the UI (User Interface), it deals with the website's overall appearance, on how interactive and dynamic it is. For masteringit, get clear with all the elements of
- HTML
- CSS
- JacaScript
- Frameworks - React, Angular, Vue etc.


3. BackEnd Development
Skills you need to have to back-end developer.
- Programming Languages
- Frameworks
- Databases
- Servers
- API (Application Program Interface)

4. Database
- MySQL - These are relational database maangement system, store and manages data. 
- MongoDB - It is a NoSQL database. Finds key - value DB, graph DBs
- VoltDB - It follows a relational pattern, they use memory to store data.


5. Version Control:
A list of Version Control Systems are:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Beanstalk
- Apache Subversion
- Mercurial


6. Build Projects:
When you're all done with the theory part, do build some projects to be well-versed with full-stack development. You implement all the front-ent, and back-end sides of a project along with database handling, then you get perfect in web development. As you build something, you get familiar with the technical concepts like how APIs connect the front-end to the back-end, how the datacase manages data, and various other steps followed during web development. Thus ccultivate a habit of building projects to become a successful web developer.
